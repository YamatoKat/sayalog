## 100Days 100Projects #2
### Challenge
I'm goint to try to put ads on my blog.

### What I did
First of all, I signed up for [Google Adsense](https://www.google.co.jp/adsense/start/).
All I had to do was paste the google adsense code. 
But it took me a while to find a place to stick that.
The place to paste it was the following.

home ▸ ⁨themes⁩ ▸ ⁨hugo-zen⁩ ▸ ⁨layouts⁩ ▸ ⁨partials⁩ ▸ ⁨header.html

I stuck it between `</head>`.

It takes 30minutes.
