## Introduction
One day, my friend shared this article; [100 DAYS - 100 PROJECTS CHALLENGE](https://www.florin-pop.com/blog/2019/09/100-days-100-projects/) with me and I was so influenced that I decided to start similar one.
Today (Arp20 2020) is the first day to be remembered.


## Day1 Redirect to www
### Challenge
My website cannot redirect to www.sayaka.com from sayaka.com at Apr20.

### What I did
I purchased a domain from [Onamae.com](https://www.onamae.com), so I can set up the transfer settings there.
The UI is very confusing, so I used [this site](https://www.dj-mope.com/entry/onamae_urltensou_settei) as a reference.
It takes 20 minutes.
